Groupz is a simple group communication protocol built on ZooKeeper, implementing
the traditional virtually synchronous group communication model. This includes
view synchrony with sending view delivery and totally ordered multicast.

Using Groupz in production is not recommended: Please use ZooKeeper directly.
Regard Groupz just as (i) an exercise on how the good old virtual synchrony maps
to the new abstraction and (maybe) how to program with ZooKeeper; (ii) a toolkit
whose API is very simple and directly matches the theoretical literature, for use in
classes and labs. It is currently being used with both these purposes at the U. Minho. 

To compile, just add zookeeper-x.x.x.jar and log4j.jar to the CLASSPATH and javac
everything. Source code is available at http://gitorious.org/groupz/.

To use, just add zookeeper-x.x.x.jar, log4j.jar, and the resulting compiled
classes to the CLASSPATH. A ZooKeeper server running of each host is required. See
http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/ for download and installation
instructions.

See NOTICE and LICENSE for copyright, usage, and distribution details. But again...
you probably want to use plain ZooKeeper directly. :-)
