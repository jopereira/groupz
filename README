Simple group communication protocol built on ZooKeeper, implementing
the traditional virtually synchronous group communication model. This
includes view synchrony with sending view delivery and totally ordered
multicast.

To install, just add groupz.jar, zookeeper-x.x.x.jar and log4j.jar. A
ZooKeeper server running of each host is required. See
http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/ for download and installation
instructions.
